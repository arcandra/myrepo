Description: The analysis in [1] showed that the level control loop LC2 had a sticking valve that caused the control loop to have a limit cycle oscillation. The disturbance caused by this control loop (Tag 22) propagated throughout the plant. A second disturbance is also present in Column 3 (Tags 23-28 and Tag 30) in the form of non-periodic transient excursions. It enters with the direct injection of steam into the column, and propagates from the bottom to the top of the column.
